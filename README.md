# Xbox_Search_API

This is a C# console application that I've built to consume and display a users XBOX Live data. 

If you intend to use this, you first have to go and create an account with xboxapi.com and retrieve an XBOX API Key.

Once, you have registered and obtained your XBOX API Key, paste it into the token field in Methods.cs.
